# Project Management Framework - AI Agent Security Platform

## Overview

This comprehensive project management framework ensures successful delivery of the AI Agent Security Platform through structured planning, execution, monitoring, and control processes. It integrates modern project management best practices with Agile methodologies and startup-specific considerations.

## Project Management Methodology

## Hybrid Approach: Agile + Traditional PM
- **Agile Development**: 2-week sprints for development activities
- **Traditional PM**: Structured planning for business and strategic activities
- **Lean Startup**: Build-Measure-Learn cycles for product validation
- **DevOps Integration**: Continuous integration and deployment practices

## Project Charter

### Project Vision
**Vision Statement**: "Create the world's first production-ready security platform for autonomous AI agents, enabling safe and compliant AI agent deployment at enterprise scale."
