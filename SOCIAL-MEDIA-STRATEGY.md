## 🎯 Key Messages

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"AgentGuard is the first open-source AI agent security SDK with client-side guardrails. Protect your AI agents from PII leakage, harmful content, and prompt injection attacks - all without server calls. Install with one command, use in three lines of code."
