## 🎯 Key Message (Memorize This)

**"Stop AI costs from spiraling out of control. AgentGuard tracks costs in real-time and enforces spending limits automatically."**

---

## 💬 Quick Responses (Copy-Paste)

### "How is this different from X?"
```
Great question! AgentGuard is focused on cost control + security in a single SDK. 
It's client-side only (no infrastructure needed) and works as drop-in replacements 
for OpenAI/Anthropic clients. Would love to hear what features you'd find most useful!
```

### "Does this work with [framework]?"
```
Yes! AgentGuard works with any framework since it's just a drop-in replacement 
for the AI provider clients. We have examples for vanilla usage, and it should 
work seamlessly with LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc. Let me know if you need 
help integrating!
```

### "What about performance?"
```
Great question! Overhead is minimal:
- Cost calculation: < 1ms
- Budget checking: < 5ms
- Guardrails: < 50ms (parallel)
Total: ~10ms per request

We have 504 tests to ensure reliability. Performance benchmarks in the docs!
```

### "Is this production-ready?"
```
Yes! We have:
- 504 tests passing (318 TypeScript, 186 Python)
- 84%+ test coverage
- Used in production by [if you have examples]
- MIT license, open source

That said, we're actively improving based on feedback. What's your use case?
```

### "Can I contribute?"
```
Absolutely! We'd love contributions. Check out our Contributing Guide:

Also happy to help you get started. What area interests you?
