# Real Metrics Strategy - Focus on Actual Users

**Date**: January 30, 2026  
**Reality Check**: npm downloads ≠ real users

---

## 🚨 The Truth About npm Downloads

You're absolutely right - npm downloads are heavily inflated by:
- 🤖 **Bots & Crawlers** - Automated scanning tools
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines** - Every build downloads packages
- 🪞 **Mirrors & Proxies** - npm mirrors count as downloads
- 📦 **Dependency Scanners** - Security tools, package explorers
- 🔍 **Search Engines** - Indexing bots
- 🏗️ **Build Tools** - Webpack, Vite, etc. downloading repeatedly

**Reality**: 10,000 downloads might = 10-50 actual users
