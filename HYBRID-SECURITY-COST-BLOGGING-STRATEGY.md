# The $50k Bill AND a Data Breach: A Startup's Nightmare (And How to Prevent Both)

## The Perfect Storm
- Small AI startup
- Launched chatbot to 5,000 users
- Weekend disaster:
  - $50k OpenAI bill
  - Customer PII leaked
  - Prompt injection attack
- Almost shut down

## What Went Wrong: The Cost Side
- No cost tracking
- No budget limits
- Attacker triggered expensive operations
- Infinite retry loops
- Bill spiraled out of control

## What Went Wrong: The Security Side
- No PII detection
- No prompt injection protection
- No content moderation
- Customer data exposed
- Compliance violation

## The Connection: How They're Related
- Attacker used prompt injection to:
  1. Extract customer data (security)
  2. Trigger expensive operations (cost)
  3. Create infinite loops (cost)
- One attack, two disasters

## The Aftermath
- Emergency shutdown
- Customer notifications (GDPR)
- Potential lawsuits
- Investor panic
- Team scramble

## How AgentGuard Prevents Both
### Security Protection:
- PII detection blocks data leaks
- Prompt injection detection stops attacks
- Content moderation prevents abuse

### Cost Protection:
- Real-time cost tracking
- Budget limits prevent overruns
- Rate limiting stops abuse

### Code Example:
```typescript
import { GuardedOpenAI } from 'agentguard-sdk';

const client = new GuardedOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  // Security guardrails
  guardrails: {
    piiDetection: true,
    promptInjection: true,
    contentModeration: true
  },
  // Cost controls
  budget: {
    maxCost: 1000, // $1000 limit
    period: 'monthly'
  },
  rateLimit: {
    maxRequests: 100,
    window: '1m'
  }
});

// Now you're protected from both security AND cost disasters
```

## Lessons Learned
1. Security and cost are connected
2. You need both protections
3. One tool is better than many
4. Prevention is cheaper than recovery
