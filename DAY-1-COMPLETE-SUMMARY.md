## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Positioning Strategy
**Decision**: Option 3 - AI Applications, Agent-First (Hybrid)

**Rationale**:
- Broader market appeal (all AI users)
- Clear differentiation (agent-grade)
- Matches product capabilities
- Room to grow

**Messaging**: "Built for agents, works for all AI"

### 2. Content Emphasis
**Decision**: Balance cost + security (50/50)

**Rationale**:
- Cost is the hook (gets clicks)
- Security is the differentiator (drives conversion)
- Both are core value props
- Broader appeal

**Title**: "Stop AI Costs from Spiraling Out of Control (While Keeping Your Data Safe)"

### 3. Blogging Platforms
**Decision**: Focus on Dev.to, Hashnode, Hacker News

**Rationale**:
- Developer-focused audiences
- High engagement
- Free, no paywalls
- Good SEO
